# Setup
In this Tutorial we show you how to run our Claire App on your computer. 

## Installments
Open a new Terminal in the Folder, where you have cloned the Claire App from Github. 
In the Terminal run the following commands and wait until the installation is done: 

npm i 

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

npm i @mui/icons-material

npm i styled-components

npm i react-router-dom

Now you have installed all the necessery modules and you can proceed to the next step: 

## Start Claire

Open the Terminal again and enter the command: 

npm start

Now go into your favorite browser and enter the URL: http://localhost:3000 
The Claire App will run now in your browser. It can take some minutes until the App is fully loaded. 
If you have an error starting Claire, it will displayed on your Terminal. It happens when there was a problem in the Installation process. The Terminal will tell you which module is missing and you can install it again. 

## Allow Claire to play sound in your browser

To use Claire with the audio assistance, you need to activate Autoplay in your Browser. 
Here is a description to acriviate Autoplay for the most popular browsers: 

Chrome & Firefox: 
https://support.zoomforth.com/en/articles/5941839-enable-video-autoplay-in-chrome-and-firefox

Safari: 
https://www.mlb.com/live-stream-games/help-center/desktop-laptop-how-to-enable-autoplay
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
